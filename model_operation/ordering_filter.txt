It recommended that you explicitly specify which field the api should allowing in the ordering filter you can do this by setting an ordering under school fields attribute on the view like so.

filter_backends = [OrderingFilter] if this is eriten only you can order from every fields 
ordering_field = ['name' , 'roll' one and more ]
