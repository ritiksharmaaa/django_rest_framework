# token authentication : - 

this auth schema uses a simple tocken-based Http auth schema . token auth is apporpriate is appropriate for client -server setup such as native desktop and mobile client .

to use the tokenauth scheme you ill need to configure the authentication classes to include tockenauth and additionaly include rest_framework.authtoken in your Install__APP setting .

INSTALL_APPS = [
    'rest_framework.authtoken'

]


make sure to run manage.py migrations after change your settings. the  rest_framework.authtocken app provide django database migrations .


this applicattion provide  table to use tocken authentication .


------------------------------------------- Tocken authenticated 

if successfully authenticated , TokenAuthentication provide the following credential , 


request.auth will be a django user instance . 

request.auth will be a rest_framework.authtoken.models.Tocken instance 


Unauthticated response that are denied permission will result in an Http 401 
Unauthticated response with an unappropriate  WWW-Authincate-header  for example: - 

   WWW-Authincate: Token 

   the http command line tool mab be usefull for testing tocken auth Api for example .



http http : //127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/'Authorizatikon':Token
you see httpie , curl 

Note : If yo use tocken Authentication in Production you must ensure that your API is only availabel over Https .

you use tocken authentication when you have token .



----------generate  token --------

using Admin Application .

Using Django manage.py Command .

    python manage.py drf_create_token username this return API Token for the given user or Create a token if token does't exists for user.

    his command work two : - if tocken already have it return that token .

    and if not it create tocken for user .


by exposing an Api endpoint . 

Using Signals 



-------------------------how client ask to create Token -----


When using token authentication you may want to provide a mechanism for client to obtain a token given the user name and password.

Rest framework provide a built in view to provide the behavior to use it at the obtain _token view to your url config.

from rest_framework.views import obtain_auth_token 

urlpatterns = [
    path('gettoken' ,  obtain_auth_token)
]



The obtain _auth _token view will return a Jason response when valid username and password field are posted to the view using from data or Json.

we use httpie for request url 

http post http://127.0.0.1:8000 /gettoken/username="name" password="pass"

if your user name and pass is valid it return a tocken 

it return as wee ll as create . 


you can also modiefued this response get some customize responose like if you want email and many more things .

you can also get user id 



-----------------------------------customize token response 


create an extra file  call auth.py -----------



seee int the file : - auth .py 


---------------generate tocken with diffrent diffrent diffrent methods  --------------------


sing Admin pannel 
using Ajngo manage.py command 
     python manage.py drf_create_tocken username 
by exposing an API endpoint . 

we can also generate token via Signals : - 


-------------------using signals 

in models file we create you can create here you want 

from djanfo.conf import settings
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import reciever 
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token 

@reciever(post_save , sender= settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def create_auth_token(sender , instance=None , created=False , **kwargs):
    if created :
    Token.objects.create(user=instance)
